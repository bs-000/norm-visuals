# ViNo - Visualisation of Norms

This repository contains the code for the legal visualisation tool for normative diagrams.


Normative diagrams are based on the idea that a
norm can be defined as a deontic modality – or rather a valuation – (i.e., prohibition, permission, obligation) ranging over a four-dimensional (space, time, object,
subject) validity domain. This code can be used to create normative diagrams for given norms and cases.

The file *examples.py* gives some examples on how to use the code.
